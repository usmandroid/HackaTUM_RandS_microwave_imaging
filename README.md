# Empty or Full? Microwave Imaging to the rescue!
## Using 6 different types of images of the empty and full boxes we try to find which method works best for detecting if the box has been emptied or not.
## To run the code ideally use google colab at https://colab.research.google.com/ (upload the final_notebook.ipynb + dir.zip from processed_data folder)
# Run the notebook to load and visualize the results.

## We found that using the type 2 images (see notebook) we get 85% train and ~70% valid accuracy!
